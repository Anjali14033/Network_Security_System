#import the function load_dotenv from the python-dotenv library.
#This function loads environment variables from a .env file into your system environment variables so Python can access them.
from dotenv import load_dotenv 

#os.getcwd() returns the current working directory where Python is running.
# This helps check whether your .env file is inside the right folder (because load_dotenv() looks in the current directory by default).

#This loads the environment variables from the .env file

#Conclusion of this above code:- We loaded environment variables from the `.env` file and printed the MongoDB connection string (`MONGODB_URL`) from it.
